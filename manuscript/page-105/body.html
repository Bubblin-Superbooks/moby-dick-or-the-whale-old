<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> He now took off his hat&mdash;a new beaver hat&mdash;when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head&mdash;none to speak of at least&mdash;nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.</p><p>Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.</p></div> </div>
