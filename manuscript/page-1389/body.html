<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&rdquo; Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo&rsquo;s.</p><p>In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford&rsquo;s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony cavities&mdash;spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan&mdash;and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side.</p></div> </div>
