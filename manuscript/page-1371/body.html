The title was, &ldquo;Dan Coopman,&rdquo; wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one &ldquo;Fitz Swackhammer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
