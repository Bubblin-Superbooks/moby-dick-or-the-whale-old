<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.</p><p>*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.</p><p>For my humor&rsquo;s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint&rsquo;s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.</p></div> </div>
