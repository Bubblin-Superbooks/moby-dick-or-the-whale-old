<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.</p><p>One old Sag-Harbor whaleman&rsquo;s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this:&mdash;He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah&rsquo;s whale with two spouts in his head&mdash;a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, &ldquo;A penny roll would choke him&rdquo;; his swallow is so very small.</p></div> </div>
