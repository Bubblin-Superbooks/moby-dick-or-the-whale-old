<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Lionel, it seems, was on his way to &ldquo;John Ferdinando,&rdquo; as he calls the modern Juan Fernandes. &ldquo;In our way thither,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;about four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.</p></div> </div>
