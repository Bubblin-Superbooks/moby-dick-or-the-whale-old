Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!&mdash;mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!&mdash;take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all a&rsquo;shiver;&mdash;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the Antilles he&rsquo;s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he jumped from a whale-boat! I&rsquo;d never beat my tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all cowards&mdash;shame upon them! Let &lsquo;em go drown like Pip, that jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
