<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days&rsquo; journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three days&rsquo; journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast. How is that?</p><p>But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to swim in.</p></div> </div>
