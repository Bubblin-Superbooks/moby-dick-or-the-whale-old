<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Your hat, your hat, sir!&rdquo; suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.</p><p>But already the sable wing was before the old man&rsquo;s eyes; the long hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize.</p><p>An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin&rsquo;s head, removing his cap to replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good. Ahab&rsquo;s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.</p></div> </div>
