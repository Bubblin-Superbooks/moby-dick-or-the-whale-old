But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab&rsquo;s) did not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship&rsquo;s high teetering side, stove in the boat&rsquo;s bottom at the stern, and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,&rdquo; said Stubb, regarding the wreck, &ldquo;but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can&rsquo;t fight it.</p></div> </div>
