In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled &ldquo;A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;&rdquo; in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crow&rsquo;s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet&rsquo;s good craft. He called it the Sleet&rsquo;s crow&rsquo;s-nest, in honour of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.</p></div> </div>
