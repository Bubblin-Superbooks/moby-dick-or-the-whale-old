Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward&mdash;I see it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
