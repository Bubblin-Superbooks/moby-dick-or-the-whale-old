<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>do you suppose that that poor fellow&rsquo;s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat&rsquo;s crew. For God&rsquo;s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man&rsquo;s blood was spilled for it.</p></div> </div>
