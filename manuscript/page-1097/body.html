Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It&rsquo;s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he&rsquo;s lost his tiller.&rdquo;</p><p>As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.</p></div> </div>
