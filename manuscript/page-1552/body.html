<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ahab&rsquo;s harpoon, the one forged at Perth&rsquo;s fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat&rsquo;s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent&rsquo;s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm&mdash;&ldquo;God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! &lsquo;tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
