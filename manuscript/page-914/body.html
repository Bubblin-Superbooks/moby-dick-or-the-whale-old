This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.</p><p>Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship&rsquo;s decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them;</p></div> </div>
