<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.</p><p>In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale&mdash;squid or cuttle-fish&mdash;lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface.</p></div> </div>
