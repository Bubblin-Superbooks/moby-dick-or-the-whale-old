At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.</p><p>There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.</p></div> </div>
