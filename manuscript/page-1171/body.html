Excepting the sublime breach&mdash;somewhere else to be described&mdash;this peaking of the whale&rsquo;s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell.</p></div> </div>
