<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner&mdash;for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.</p><p>In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years&rsquo; voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire months.</p></div> </div>
