<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil.</p><p>Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with&mdash;that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale&rsquo;s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.</p></div> </div>
