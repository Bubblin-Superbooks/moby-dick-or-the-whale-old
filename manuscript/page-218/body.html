<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin&rsquo;s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.</p><p>&ldquo;Capting! Capting!&rdquo; yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; &ldquo;Capting, Capting, here&rsquo;s the devil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hallo, you sir,&rdquo; cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, &ldquo;what in thunder do you mean by that? Don&rsquo;t you know you might have killed that chap?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
