<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb&rsquo;s long spade&mdash;still remaining there after the whale&rsquo;s Decapitation&mdash;and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.</p><p>It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx&rsquo;s in the desert. &ldquo;Speak, thou vast and venerable head,&rdquo; muttered Ahab, &ldquo;which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest.</p></div> </div>
