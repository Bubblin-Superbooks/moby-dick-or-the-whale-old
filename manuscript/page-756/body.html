<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>GAM. NOUN&mdash;A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships, generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats&rsquo; crews; the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.</p><p>There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner&rsquo;s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all.</p></div> </div>
