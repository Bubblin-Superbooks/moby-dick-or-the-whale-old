<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn&rsquo;s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world&rsquo;s circumference, not an inhabitable hand&rsquo;s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the whale&rsquo;s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab&rsquo;s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh&rsquo;s. Methuselah seems a school-boy.</p></div> </div>
