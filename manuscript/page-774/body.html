By the Lord, it&rsquo;s worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad&rsquo;s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he&rsquo;s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of &lsquo;em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I&rsquo;d tell him to jump overboard and scatter &lsquo;em. They&rsquo;re playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him.</p></div> </div>
