<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Cook,&rdquo; said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think this steak is rather overdone? You&rsquo;ve been beating this steak too much, cook; it&rsquo;s too tender. Don&rsquo;t I always say that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks now over the side, don&rsquo;t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to &lsquo;em; tell &lsquo;em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,&rdquo; snatching one from his sideboard; &ldquo;now then, go and preach to &lsquo;em!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
