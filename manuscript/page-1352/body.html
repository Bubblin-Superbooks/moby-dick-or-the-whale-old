<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop&rsquo;s boat, which, d&rsquo;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir&mdash;hearts and souls alive, man&mdash;the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat&mdash;both eyes out&mdash;all befogged and bedeadened with black foam&mdash;the whale&rsquo;s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it overboard&mdash;down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out.</p></div> </div>
