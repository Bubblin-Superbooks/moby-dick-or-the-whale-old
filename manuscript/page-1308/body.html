<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp&mdash;all others but liars!</p><p>Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia&rsquo;s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome&rsquo;s accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true&mdash;not true, or undeveloped. With books the same.</p></div> </div>
