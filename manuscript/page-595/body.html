<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.</p><p>Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man&rsquo;s soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.</p></div> </div>
