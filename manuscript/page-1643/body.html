<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The clothes that the night had wet, the next day&rsquo;s sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.</p><p>He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,&mdash;breakfast and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee&rsquo;s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak&mdash;one man to the other&mdash;unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary.</p></div> </div>
