<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log was gone.</p><p>&ldquo;I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line. See to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There he goes now; to him nothing&rsquo;s happened; but to me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
