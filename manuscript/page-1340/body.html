Any way, for the present, I&rsquo;ll quit Pip&rsquo;s vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he&rsquo;s too crazy-witty for my sanity.

But, unscrew your navel, and what&rsquo;s the consequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught&rsquo;s nailed to the mast it&rsquo;s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he&rsquo;ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey&rsquo;s wedding ring.</p></div> </div>
