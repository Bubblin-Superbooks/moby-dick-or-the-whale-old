<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. &lsquo;Tis Ahab&mdash;his body&rsquo;s part; but Ahab&rsquo;s soul&rsquo;s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye&rsquo;ll hear me crack; and till ye hear that, know that Ahab&rsquo;s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick&mdash;two days he&rsquo;s floated&mdash;tomorrow will be the third.</p></div> </div>
