<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale&rsquo;s head.</p><p>As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale&rsquo;s head may be compared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale&rsquo;s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker&rsquo;s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her progeny.</p></div> </div>
