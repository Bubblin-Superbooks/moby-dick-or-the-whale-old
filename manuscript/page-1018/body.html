<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&rsquo;t the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral&rsquo;s cabin, don&rsquo;t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
