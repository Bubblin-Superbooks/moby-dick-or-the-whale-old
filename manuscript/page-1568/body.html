<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod&rsquo;s jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached to it&mdash;for they were slack&mdash;because some play to the tiller was indispensable.</p><p>In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the Pequod&rsquo;s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.</p></div> </div>
