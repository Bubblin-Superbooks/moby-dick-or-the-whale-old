<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled at last&mdash;&ldquo;the squall&rsquo;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&rsquo;s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&rsquo;s thy name, didn&rsquo;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Captain Peleg,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have a friend with me who wants to ship too&mdash;shall I bring him down to-morrow?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
