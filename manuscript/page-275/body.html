<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Captain Peleg,&rdquo; said Bildad steadily, &ldquo;thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&rsquo;t tell; but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&rsquo;s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he&rsquo;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on.</p></div> </div>
