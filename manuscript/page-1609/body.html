<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?&rdquo; moving his hand as with a pitch-pot.</p><p>&ldquo;Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no more.&mdash;Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I don&rsquo;t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won&rsquo;t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I&rsquo;m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It&rsquo;s like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don&rsquo;t like this cobbling sort of business&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it at all; it&rsquo;s undignified; it&rsquo;s not my place. Let tinkers&rsquo; brats do tinkerings; we are their betters.</p></div> </div>
