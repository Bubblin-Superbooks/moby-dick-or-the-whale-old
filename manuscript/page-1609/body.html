<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship&rsquo;s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.

We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I&rsquo;ll do the job, now, tenderly. I&rsquo;ll have me&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;how many in the ship&rsquo;s company, all told? But I&rsquo;ve forgotten.</p></div> </div>
