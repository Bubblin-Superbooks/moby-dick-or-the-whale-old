<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say&rsquo;st the men have vow&rsquo;d thy vow; say&rsquo;st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!&mdash;But is there no other way? no lawful way?&mdash;Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man&rsquo;s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest.</p></div> </div>
