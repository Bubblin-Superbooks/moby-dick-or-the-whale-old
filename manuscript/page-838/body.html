<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.</p><p>I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett&rsquo;s, Huggins&rsquo;s, Frederick Cuvier&rsquo;s, and Beale&rsquo;s. In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins&rsquo;s is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale&rsquo;s is the best. All Beale&rsquo;s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect.</p></div> </div>
