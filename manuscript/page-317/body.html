<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Captain Ahab.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seen him yet, have ye?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, we hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be all right again before long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right again before long!&rdquo; laughed the stranger, with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh. &ldquo;Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
