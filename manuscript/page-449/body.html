<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor&rsquo; West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.</p><p>Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans.</p></div> </div>
