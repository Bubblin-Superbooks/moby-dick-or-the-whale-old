The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (They scatter.)</p><p>PIP (shrinking under the windlass). Jollies? Lord help such jollies! Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard! It&rsquo;s worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of the year! Who&rsquo;d go climbing after chestnuts now? But there they go, all cursing, and here I don&rsquo;t. Fine prospects to &lsquo;em; they&rsquo;re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps there are worse yet&mdash;they are your white squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just now, and the white whale&mdash;shirr! shirr!&mdash;but spoken of once! and only this evening&mdash;</p></div> </div>
