<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.</p><p>Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way&mdash;cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round&mdash;you enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft&rsquo;s cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world&rsquo;s remotest nooks.</p></div> </div>
