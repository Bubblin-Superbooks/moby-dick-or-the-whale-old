<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).&mdash;This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio whale&rsquo;s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.</p><p>Thus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).</p><p>DUODECIMOES.&mdash;These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.</p><p>To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES&mdash;a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness.</p></div> </div>
