Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring&mdash;aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble.

I&rsquo;ll smoke no more&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
