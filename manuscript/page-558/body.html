(Quietly smoking) That&rsquo;s a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.</p><p>OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over. I&rsquo;ll dance over your grave, I will&mdash;that&rsquo;s the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the whole world&rsquo;s a ball, as you scholars have it; and so &lsquo;tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you&rsquo;re young; I was once.</p></div> </div>
