Spell oh!&mdash;whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm&mdash;give us a whiff, Tash.</p><p>(They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky darkens&mdash;the wind rises.)</p><p>LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it&rsquo;ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born, high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!</p><p>MALTESE SAILOR. (Reclining and shaking his cap.) It&rsquo;s the waves&mdash;the snow&rsquo;s caps turn to jig it now. They&rsquo;ll shake their tassels soon. Now would all the waves were women, then I&rsquo;d go drown, and chassee with them evermore! There&rsquo;s naught so sweet on earth&mdash;heaven may not match it!&mdash;as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.</p></div> </div>
