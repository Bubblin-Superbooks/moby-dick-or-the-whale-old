<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing &lsquo;gainst the side! Stand by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they&rsquo;ll go lunging presently.</p><p>DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He&rsquo;s no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!</p><p>4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol&mdash;fire your ship right into it!</p></div> </div>
