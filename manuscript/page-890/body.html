Don&rsquo;t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time&mdash;but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. &ldquo;Start her, now; give &lsquo;em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy&mdash;start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool&mdash;cucumbers is the word&mdash;easy, easy&mdash;only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. Start her!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!&rdquo; screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.</p></div> </div>
