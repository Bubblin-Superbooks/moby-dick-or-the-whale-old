Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;&mdash;that&rsquo;s not good. Best spill it?&mdash;wait. I&rsquo;ll cure myself of this. I&rsquo;ll hold the musket boldly while I think.&mdash;I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,&mdash;that&rsquo;s fair for Moby Dick. It&rsquo;s a fair wind that&rsquo;s only fair for that accursed fish.&mdash;The very tube he pointed at me!&mdash;the very one; this one&mdash;I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.&mdash;Aye and he would fain kill all his crew.</p></div> </div>
