<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;All about it, eh&mdash;sure you do?&mdash;all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pretty sure.&rdquo;</p><p>With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well, what&rsquo;s signed, is signed; and what&rsquo;s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won&rsquo;t be, after all. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s all fixed and arranged a&rsquo;ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity &lsquo;em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I&rsquo;m sorry I stopped ye.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
