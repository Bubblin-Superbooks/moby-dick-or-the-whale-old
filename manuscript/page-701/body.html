<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Pull, pull, my good boys,&rdquo; said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.</p><p>How different the loud little King-Post. &ldquo;Sing out and say something, my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I&rsquo;ll sign over to you my Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys.</p></div> </div>
