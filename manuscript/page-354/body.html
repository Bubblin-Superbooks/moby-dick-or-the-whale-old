<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Luck to ye, Starbuck&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Stubb&mdash;luck to ye, Mr. Flask&mdash;good-bye and good luck to ye all&mdash;and this day three years I&rsquo;ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,&rdquo; murmured old Bildad, almost incoherently. &ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll have fine weather now, so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye&mdash;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye&rsquo;ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don&rsquo;t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent. within the year. Don&rsquo;t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper don&rsquo;t waste the spare staves.</p></div> </div>
