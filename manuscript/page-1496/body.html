<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for though thou only see&rsquo;st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into the bone of my skull&mdash;that is all wrinkles! But, away with child&rsquo;s play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!&rdquo; jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. &ldquo;I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There&rsquo;s the stuff,&rdquo; flinging the pouch upon the anvil. &ldquo;Look ye, blacksmith, these are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
