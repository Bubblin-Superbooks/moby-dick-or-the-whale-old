Hark ye, lad&mdash;fleet interlacings of the limbs&mdash;lithe swayings&mdash;coyings&mdash;flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (Nudging.)</p><p>TAHITAN SAILOR. (Reclining on a mat.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!&mdash;the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!&mdash;not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee&rsquo;s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?&mdash;The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps to his feet.)</p></div> </div>
