Let me board you a moment&mdash;I come in peace.&rsquo; With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike me!&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
