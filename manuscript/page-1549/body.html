<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The corpusants have mercy on us all,&rdquo; cried Stubb, again.</p><p>At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab&rsquo;s front, but with his head bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes upcast.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, men!&rdquo; cried Ahab. &ldquo;Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
