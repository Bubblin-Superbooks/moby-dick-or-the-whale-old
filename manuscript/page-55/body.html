Who ain&rsquo;t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about&mdash;however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way&mdash;either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other&rsquo;s shoulder-blades, and be content.</p><p>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay.</p></div> </div>
