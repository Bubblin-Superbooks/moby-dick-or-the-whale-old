<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I&rsquo;ll blow the fire.&rdquo;</p><p>When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. &ldquo;A flaw!&rdquo; rejecting the last one. &ldquo;Work that over again, Perth.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
