<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.</p><p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye see him?&rdquo; cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.</p><p>&ldquo;In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that&rsquo;s all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here&rsquo;s food for thought, had Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that&rsquo;s tingling enough for mortal man! to think&rsquo;s audacity. God only has that right and privilege.</p></div> </div>
