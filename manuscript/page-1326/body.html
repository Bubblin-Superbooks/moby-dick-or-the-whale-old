<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,&mdash;three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician&rsquo;s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then.</p></div> </div>
