<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let&rsquo;s have that ferule and buckle-screw; I&rsquo;ll be ready for them presently. Lucky now (sneezes) there&rsquo;s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a little; but a mere shinbone&mdash;why it&rsquo;s easy as making hop-poles; only I should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I&rsquo;ve seen in shop windows wouldn&rsquo;t compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess.</p></div> </div>
