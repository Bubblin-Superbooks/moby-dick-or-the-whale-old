And fetch him where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Up dere,&rdquo; said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and keeping it there very solemnly.</p><p>&ldquo;So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you are dead? But don&rsquo;t you know the higher you climb, the colder it gets? Main-top, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say dat t&rsquo;all,&rdquo; said Fleece, again in the sulks.</p><p>&ldquo;You said up there, didn&rsquo;t you? and now look yourself, and see where your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber&rsquo;s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don&rsquo;t get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It&rsquo;s a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it&rsquo;s no go.</p></div> </div>
