<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the other at his forge&rsquo;s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil&mdash;the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.</p><p>&ldquo;Are these thy Mother Carey&rsquo;s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;&mdash;look here, they burn; but thou&mdash;thou liv&rsquo;st among them without a scorch.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
