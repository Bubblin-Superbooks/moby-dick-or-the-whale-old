<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man&rsquo;s a grand old cove! We are the lads to hunt him up his whale!</p><p>ALL. Aye! aye!</p><p>OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there&rsquo;s none but the crew&rsquo;s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there&rsquo;s another in the sky&mdash;lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.</p><p>DAGGOO. What of that? Who&rsquo;s afraid of black&rsquo;s afraid of me! I&rsquo;m quarried out of it!</p></div> </div>
