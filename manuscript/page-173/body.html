<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. &lsquo;Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!&rsquo; he groans, &lsquo;straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there&rsquo;s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah&rsquo;s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.</p></div> </div>
