Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?&mdash;Aloft there! which way?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dead to leeward, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the spare boats and rig them&mdash;Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat&rsquo;s crews.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
