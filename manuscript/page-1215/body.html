They fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,&mdash;furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.</p><p>But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem&rsquo;s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.</p></div> </div>
