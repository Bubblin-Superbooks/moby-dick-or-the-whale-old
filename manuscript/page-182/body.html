<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him&mdash;a far, far upward, and inward delight&mdash;who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,&mdash;top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven.</p></div> </div>
