But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel&rsquo;s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship&rsquo;s lightning-rods are not always overboard;</p></div> </div>
