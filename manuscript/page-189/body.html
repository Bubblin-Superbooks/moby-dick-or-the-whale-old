<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is&mdash;which was the only way he could get there&mdash;thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must have &ldquo;broken his digester.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
