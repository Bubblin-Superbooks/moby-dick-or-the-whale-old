<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer&rsquo;s (Thomas Cranmer) sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.</p><p>There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!</p></div> </div>
