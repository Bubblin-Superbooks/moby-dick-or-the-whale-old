<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth&mdash;pagans and all included&mdash;can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?&mdash;to do the will of God&mdash;that is worship. And what is the will of God?&mdash;to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me&mdash;that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator.</p></div> </div>
