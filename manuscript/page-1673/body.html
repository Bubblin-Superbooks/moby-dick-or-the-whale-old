<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,&mdash;quick, quicker!&rdquo; and he slid through the air to the deck.</p><p>&ldquo;He is heading straight to leeward, sir,&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;right away from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!&mdash;brace up! Shiver her!&mdash;shiver her!&mdash;So; well that! Boats, boats!&rdquo;</p><p>Soon all the boats but Starbuck&rsquo;s were dropped; all the boat-sails set&mdash;all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah&rsquo;s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.</p></div> </div>
