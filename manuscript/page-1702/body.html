<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There she blows&mdash;she blows!&mdash;she blows!&mdash;right ahead!&rdquo; was now the mast-head cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, aye!&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;I knew it&mdash;ye can&rsquo;t escape&mdash;blow on and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your trump&mdash;blister your lungs!&mdash;Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream!&rdquo;</p><p>And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison.</p></div> </div>
