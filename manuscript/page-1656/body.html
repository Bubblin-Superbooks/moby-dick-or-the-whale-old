<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion&mdash;most seen here at the Equator&mdash;denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.</p><p>Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl&rsquo;s forehead of heaven.</p><p>Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
