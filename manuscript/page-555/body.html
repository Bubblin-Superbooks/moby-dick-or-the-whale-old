Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!</p><p>PIP. (Sulky and sleepy) Don&rsquo;t know where it is.</p><p>FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry&rsquo;s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won&rsquo;t you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!</p></div> </div>
