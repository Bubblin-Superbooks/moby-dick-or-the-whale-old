But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here&rdquo; (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); &ldquo;yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell&rsquo;s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh&mdash;clear along the whole length of my arm&mdash;came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;&mdash;and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain&mdash;Dr. Bunger, ship&rsquo;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,&mdash;the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
