<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called &ldquo;fritters&rdquo;; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives&rsquo; dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.</p><p>But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo&rsquo;s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter.</p></div> </div>
