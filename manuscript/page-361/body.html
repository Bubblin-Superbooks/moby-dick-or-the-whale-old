But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship&rsquo;s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights &lsquo;gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed sea&rsquo;s landlessness again; for refuge&rsquo;s sake forlornly rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!</p><p>Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?</p></div> </div>
