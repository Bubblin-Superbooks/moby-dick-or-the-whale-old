<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> straightway the whale&rsquo;s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log&mdash;shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware! And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held. There&rsquo;s your law of precedents; there&rsquo;s your utility of traditions; there&rsquo;s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in the air! There&rsquo;s orthodoxy!</p><p>Thus, while in life the great whale&rsquo;s body may have been a real terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world.</p></div> </div>
