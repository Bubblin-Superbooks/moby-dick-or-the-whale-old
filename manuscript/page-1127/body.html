<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.</p><p>Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda&mdash;indeed, by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it&mdash;is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other. &ldquo;Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,&rdquo; saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep.</p></div> </div>
