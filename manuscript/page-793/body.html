Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don&rsquo;t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we&rsquo;re your men; but we won&rsquo;t be flogged.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look ye, now,&rsquo; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, &lsquo;there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d&rsquo;ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don&rsquo;t want a row; it&rsquo;s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&rsquo;t be flogged.&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
