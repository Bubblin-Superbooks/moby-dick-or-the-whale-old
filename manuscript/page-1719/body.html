<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What more wouldst thou have?&mdash;Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,&mdash;Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Starbuck, of late I&rsquo;ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that hour we both saw&mdash;thou know&rsquo;st what, in one another&rsquo;s eyes. But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand&mdash;a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This whole act&rsquo;s immutably decreed. &lsquo;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates&rsquo; lieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.&mdash;Stand round me, men.</p></div> </div>
