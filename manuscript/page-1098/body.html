<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Only wait a bit, old chap, and I&rsquo;ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm,&rdquo; cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.</p><p>&ldquo;Mind he don&rsquo;t sling thee with it,&rdquo; cried Starbuck. &ldquo;Give way, or the German will have him.&rdquo;</p><p>With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture the Pequod&rsquo;s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had, Derick&rsquo;s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign rivals.</p></div> </div>
