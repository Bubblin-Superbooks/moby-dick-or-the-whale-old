<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first kick.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don&rsquo;t ye spring, I say, all of ye&mdash;spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!&rdquo; And so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.</p></div> </div>
