The jaws of it stand for a gate in the garden of Pitferren.&rdquo; &mdash;Sibbald&rsquo;s Fife and Kinross.</p><p>&ldquo;Myself have agreed to try whether I can master and kill this Sperma-ceti whale, for I could never hear of any of that sort that was killed by any man, such is his fierceness and swiftness.&rdquo; &mdash;Richard Strafford&rsquo;s Letter from the Bermudas.
