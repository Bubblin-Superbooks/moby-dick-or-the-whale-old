Aye, and that&rsquo;s what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale&rsquo;s at the bottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can&rsquo;t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It ain&rsquo;t the White Whale to-day! Give way!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
