<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here&rsquo;s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There&rsquo;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&rsquo;s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&rsquo;s hear what he&rsquo;ll have to say. There; he&rsquo;s before it; he&rsquo;ll out with something presently. So, so; he&rsquo;s beginning.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
