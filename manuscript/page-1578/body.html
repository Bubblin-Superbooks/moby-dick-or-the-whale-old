<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod&rsquo;s gurgling track, pushed her on like giants&rsquo; palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.</p><p>Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye the bright sun&rsquo;s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun&rsquo;s rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.</p></div> </div>
