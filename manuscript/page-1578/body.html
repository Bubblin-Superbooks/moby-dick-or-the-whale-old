Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!&rdquo;</p><p>Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man&rsquo;s tormented sleep, as if Starbuck&rsquo;s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak.</p><p>The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard&rsquo;s arm against the panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know&rsquo;st what to say.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
