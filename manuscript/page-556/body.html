Eight bells there! d&rsquo;ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I&rsquo;ve the sort of mouth for that&mdash;the hogshead mouth. So, so, (thrusts his head down the scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!</p><p>DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old Mogul&rsquo;s wine; it&rsquo;s quite as deadening to some as filliping to others. We sing; they sleep&mdash;aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts. At &lsquo;em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail &lsquo;em through it. Tell &lsquo;em to avast dreaming of their lasses.</p></div> </div>
