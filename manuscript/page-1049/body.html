<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be very long in following.</p><p>Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale&rsquo;s there? It is the same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head&rsquo;s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel&rsquo;s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years.</p></div> </div>
