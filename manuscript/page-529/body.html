How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a little lower layer. If money&rsquo;s to be the measurer, man, and the accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
