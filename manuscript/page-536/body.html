Cant them; cant them over! know ye not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!&rdquo; Forthwith, slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful whaleboat&rsquo;s bow&mdash;Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
