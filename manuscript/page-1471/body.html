This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.</p><p>When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.</p><p>Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one&rsquo;s consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any denying him;</p></div> </div>
