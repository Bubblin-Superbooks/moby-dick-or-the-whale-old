Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says he&rsquo;s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer; he&rsquo;s queer, says Stubb; he&rsquo;s queer&mdash;queer, queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the time&mdash;queer&mdash;sir&mdash;queer, queer, very queer. And here&rsquo;s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here&rsquo;s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale&rsquo;s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he&rsquo;ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell&mdash;how was that? Oh! I don&rsquo;t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I&rsquo;m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that&rsquo;s only haphazard-like.</p></div> </div>
