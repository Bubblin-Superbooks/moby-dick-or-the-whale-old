This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain&rsquo;s round-house (cabinet he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.</p><p>Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris.</p></div> </div>
