<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name do you want here?&rdquo; roared the Guernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! keep cool&mdash;cool? yes, that&rsquo;s the word! why don&rsquo;t you pack those whales in ice while you&rsquo;re working at &lsquo;em? But joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it&rsquo;s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn&rsquo;t a gill in his whole carcase.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that well enough; but, d&rsquo;ye see, the Captain here won&rsquo;t believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he&rsquo;ll believe you, if he won&rsquo;t me; and so I&rsquo;ll get out of this dirty scrape.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
