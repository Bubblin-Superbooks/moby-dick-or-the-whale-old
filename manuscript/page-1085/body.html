<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale&rsquo;s proper brain, you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped&rsquo;s spine, you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.</p></div> </div>
