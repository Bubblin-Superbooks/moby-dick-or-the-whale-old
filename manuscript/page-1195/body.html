They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat&rsquo;s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.</p><p>It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale&rsquo;s way greatly diminished;</p></div> </div>
