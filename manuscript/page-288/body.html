<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Wood-house!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;which way to it? Run for God&rsquo;s sake, and fetch something to pry open the door&mdash;the axe!&mdash;the axe! he&rsquo;s had a stroke; depend upon it!&rdquo;&mdash;and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, young man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get the axe! For God&rsquo;s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it open!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; &ldquo;look here; are you talking about prying open any of my doors?&rdquo;&mdash;and with that she seized my arm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? What&rsquo;s the matter with you, shipmate?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
