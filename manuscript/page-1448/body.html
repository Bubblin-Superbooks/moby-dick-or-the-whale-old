Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I&rsquo;m down in the whole world&rsquo;s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was the world&rsquo;s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I&rsquo;ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.</p></div> </div>
