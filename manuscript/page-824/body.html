It is Guido&rsquo;s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own &ldquo;Perseus Descending,&rdquo; make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water.</p></div> </div>
