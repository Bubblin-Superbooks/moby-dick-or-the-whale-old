<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening and the end of that thing&mdash;be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,&mdash;fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem clearing; but clouds sweep between&mdash;Is my journey&rsquo;s end coming? My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,&mdash;beats it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!&mdash;stave it off&mdash;move, move! speak aloud!&mdash;Mast-head there! See ye my boy&rsquo;s hand on the hill?&mdash;Crazed;&mdash;aloft there!&mdash;keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:&mdash;</p></div> </div>
