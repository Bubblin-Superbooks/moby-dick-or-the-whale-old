Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; cried Stubb, &ldquo;but sea-coal ashes&mdash;mind ye that, Mr. Starbuck&mdash;sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab mutter, &lsquo;Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.&rsquo; And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
