<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. &ldquo;In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,&rdquo; says an old writer&mdash;of whose works I possess the only copy extant&mdash;&ldquo;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&rdquo; True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind&mdash;old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn&rsquo;t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&rsquo;s too late to make any improvements now.</p></div> </div>
