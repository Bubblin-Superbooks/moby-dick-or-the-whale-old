Hark! he&rsquo;s muttering&mdash;voice like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when the sun stands in some one of these signs. I&rsquo;ve studied signs, and know their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what&rsquo;s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign&mdash;the roaring and devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
