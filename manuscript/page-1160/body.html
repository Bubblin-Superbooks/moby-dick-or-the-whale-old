<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.</p><p>And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that vapour&mdash;as you will sometimes see it&mdash;glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d&rsquo;ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate vapour.</p></div> </div>
