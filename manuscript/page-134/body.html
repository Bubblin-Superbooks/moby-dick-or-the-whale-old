<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas&mdash;entire strangers to them&mdash;and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table&mdash;all of the same calling, all of kindred tastes&mdash;looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!</p></div> </div>
