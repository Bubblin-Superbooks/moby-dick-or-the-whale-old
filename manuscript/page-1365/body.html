<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.</p><p>In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia&rsquo;s example was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open.</p></div> </div>
