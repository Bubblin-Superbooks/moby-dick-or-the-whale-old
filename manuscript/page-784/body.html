They were both Canallers.</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Canallers!&rsquo; cried Don Pedro. &lsquo;We have seen many whale-ships in our harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are they?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You must have heard of it.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye?
