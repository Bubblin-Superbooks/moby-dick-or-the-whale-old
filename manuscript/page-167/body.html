<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How plainly he&rsquo;s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,&mdash;no friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger&rsquo;s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other&mdash;&ldquo;Jack, he&rsquo;s robbed a widow;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Joe, do you mark him; he&rsquo;s a bigamist;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Harry lad, I guess he&rsquo;s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.</p></div> </div>
