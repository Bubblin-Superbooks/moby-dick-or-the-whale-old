<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.</p><p>In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in life&mdash;as we have elsewhere seen&mdash;this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater&mdash;in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth&mdash;reposes the mere handful of this monster&rsquo;s brain.</p></div> </div>
