Browne, V.E.</p><p>It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the Pequod&rsquo;s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.</p><p>&ldquo;I will bet something now,&rdquo; said Stubb, &ldquo;that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they would keel up before long.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
