<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there&rsquo;s Aries, or the Ram&mdash;lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull&mdash;he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins&mdash;that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path&mdash;he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that&rsquo;s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales&mdash;happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself.</p></div> </div>
