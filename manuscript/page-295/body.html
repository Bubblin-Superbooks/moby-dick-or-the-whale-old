You&rsquo;ll starve; you&rsquo;ll kill yourself, Queequeg.&rdquo; But not a word did he reply.</p><p>Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg&mdash;not four feet off&mdash;sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.</p></div> </div>
