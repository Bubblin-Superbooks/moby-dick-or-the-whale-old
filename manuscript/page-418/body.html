Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. It&rsquo;s queer; very queer; and he&rsquo;s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he&rsquo;s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!&mdash;his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there&rsquo;s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.</p></div> </div>
