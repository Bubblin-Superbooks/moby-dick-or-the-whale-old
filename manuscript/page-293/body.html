<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do&mdash;for all my polite arts and blandishments&mdash;he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in the slightest way.</p><p>I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes, it&rsquo;s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he&rsquo;ll get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can&rsquo;t last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s very punctual then.</p></div> </div>
