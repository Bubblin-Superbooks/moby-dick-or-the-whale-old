<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip&rsquo;s missing. Let&rsquo;s see now if ye haven&rsquo;t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess he&rsquo;s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here. Ho! there&rsquo;s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off&mdash;we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here&rsquo;s Pip, trying to get on board again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peace, thou crazy loon,&rdquo; cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. &ldquo;Away from the quarter-deck!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,&rdquo; muttered Ahab, advancing. &ldquo;Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?</p></div> </div>
