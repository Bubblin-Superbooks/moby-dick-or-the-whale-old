<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except&mdash;but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, Stick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from the boat, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, &ldquo;Stick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won&rsquo;t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can&rsquo;t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don&rsquo;t jump any more.</p></div> </div>
