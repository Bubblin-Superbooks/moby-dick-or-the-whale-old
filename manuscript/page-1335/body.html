<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg&mdash;all tattooing&mdash;looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the Cannibal? As I live he&rsquo;s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon&rsquo;s Astronomy in the back country. And by Jove, he&rsquo;s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh&mdash;I guess it&rsquo;s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don&rsquo;t know what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king&rsquo;s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.</p></div> </div>
