Man, man! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, sir,&rdquo; said Starbuck drawing near, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis a solemn sight; an omen, and an ill one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Omen? omen?&mdash;the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and give an old wives&rsquo; darkling hint.&mdash;Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold&mdash;I shiver!&mdash;How now? Aloft there! D&rsquo;ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times a second!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
