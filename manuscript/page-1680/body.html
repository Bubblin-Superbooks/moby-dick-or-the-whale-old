Their vision was keener than man&rsquo;s; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick&rsquo;s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.</p></div> </div>
