Here, then, I&rsquo;ll seat me, against the transom, in the ship&rsquo;s full middle, all her keel and her three masts before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what&rsquo;s this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy&rsquo;s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats!&mdash;Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?&mdash;a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;&mdash;seen him? No! Well then, fill up again, captains, and let&rsquo;s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table.</p></div> </div>
