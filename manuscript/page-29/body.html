(A small sized one.)</p><p>&ldquo;The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the water-works at London Bridge, and the water roaring in its passage through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood gushing from the whale&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo; &mdash;Paley&rsquo;s Theology.</p></div> </div>
