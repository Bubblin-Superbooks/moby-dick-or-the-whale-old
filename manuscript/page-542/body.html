<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I laugh and hoot at ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies&mdash;Take some one of your own size; don&rsquo;t pommel me! No, ye&rsquo;ve knocked me down, and I am up again; but ye have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab&rsquo;s compliments to ye; come and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents&rsquo; beds, unerringly I rush! Naught&rsquo;s an obstacle, naught&rsquo;s an angle to the iron way!</p></div> </div>
