<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. &lsquo;What are you &lsquo;bout?&rsquo; says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. &lsquo;What am I about?&rsquo; says I at last. &lsquo;And what business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?&rsquo; By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout&mdash;what do you think, I saw?&mdash;why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, &lsquo;I guess I won&rsquo;t kick you, old fellow.</p></div> </div>
