<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Projecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den&mdash;the bar&mdash;a rude attempt at a right whale&rsquo;s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale&rsquo;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.</p><p>Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true cylinders without&mdash;within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads&rsquo; goblets.</p></div> </div>
