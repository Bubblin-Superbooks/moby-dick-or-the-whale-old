It&rsquo;s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a fierce red flame there!</p><p>Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.</p><p>Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what&rsquo;s made in fire must properly belong to fire; and so hell&rsquo;s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of.</p></div> </div>
