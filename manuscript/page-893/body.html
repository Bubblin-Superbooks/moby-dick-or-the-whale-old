Stubb and Tashtego here changed places&mdash;stem for stern&mdash;a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion.</p><p>*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.</p><p>From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would have thought the craft had two keels&mdash;one cleaving the water, the other the air&mdash;as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once.</p></div> </div>
