<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ahab and all his boat&rsquo;s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.</p><p>Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world. &ldquo;I have dreamed it again,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
