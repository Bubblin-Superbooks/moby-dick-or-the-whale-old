<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan&mdash;to an ant or a flea&mdash;such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer&rsquo;s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.</p><p>One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals.</p></div> </div>
