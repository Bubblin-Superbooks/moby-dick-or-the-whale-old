<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,&mdash;as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell again&mdash;gunwale downwards&mdash;and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.</p><p>The first uprising momentum of the whale&mdash;modifying its direction as he struck the surface&mdash;involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea.</p></div> </div>
