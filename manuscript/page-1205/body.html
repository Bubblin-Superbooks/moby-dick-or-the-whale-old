Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.</p><p>&ldquo;Oars! Oars!&rdquo; he intensely whispered, seizing the helm&mdash;&ldquo;gripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg&mdash;the whale there!&mdash;prick him!&mdash;hit him! Stand up&mdash;stand up, and stay so! Spring, men&mdash;pull, men; never mind their backs&mdash;scrape them!&mdash;scrape away!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
