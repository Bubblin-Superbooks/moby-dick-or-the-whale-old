She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years&rsquo; water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer&mdash;&ldquo;Well, boys, here&rsquo;s the ark!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
