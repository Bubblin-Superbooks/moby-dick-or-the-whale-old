These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab&rsquo;s.</p><p>The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale&rsquo;s spout-hole; and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale&rsquo;s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.</p></div> </div>
