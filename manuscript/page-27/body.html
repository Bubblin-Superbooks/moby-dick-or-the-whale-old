They stand in so great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near approach.&rdquo; &mdash;Uno Von Troil&rsquo;s Letters on Banks&rsquo;s and Solander&rsquo;s Voyage to Iceland in 1772.</p><p>&ldquo;The Spermacetti Whale found by the Nantuckois, is an active, fierce animal, and requires vast address and boldness in the fishermen.&rdquo; &mdash;Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s Whale Memorial to the French minister in 1778.</p></div> </div>
