<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The drama&rsquo;s done. Why then here does any one step forth?&mdash;Because one did survive the wreck.</p><p>It so chanced, that after the Parsee&rsquo;s disappearance, I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab&rsquo;s bowsman, when that bowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve.</p></div> </div>
