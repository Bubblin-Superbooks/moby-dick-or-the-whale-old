I thought to find one stubborn, at the least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be wasting! What I&rsquo;ve dared, I&rsquo;ve willed; and what I&rsquo;ve willed, I&rsquo;ll do! They think me mad&mdash;Starbuck does; but I&rsquo;m demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that&rsquo;s only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered; and&mdash;Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That&rsquo;s more than ye, ye great gods, ever were.</p></div> </div>
