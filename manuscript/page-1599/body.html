<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? here&rsquo;s velvet shark-skin,&rdquo; intently gazing at Ahab&rsquo;s hand, and feeling it. &ldquo;Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne&rsquo;er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an Emperor&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
