<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preternatural light, Queequeg&rsquo;s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body.</p><p>The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb. &ldquo;What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the song.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, it wasn&rsquo;t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?&mdash;have they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck&mdash;but it&rsquo;s too dark to look.</p></div> </div>
