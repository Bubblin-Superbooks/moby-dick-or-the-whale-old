<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The living member&mdash;that makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid&mdash;so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s his leg now, but a cane&mdash;a whalebone cane. Yes,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;it was only a playful cudgelling&mdash;in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me&mdash;not a base kick. Besides,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;look at it once; why, the end of it&mdash;the foot part&mdash;what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, there&rsquo;s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.&rsquo; But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.</p></div> </div>
