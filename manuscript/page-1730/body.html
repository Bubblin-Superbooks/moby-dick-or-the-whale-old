<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there&rsquo;s time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!&mdash;the same!&mdash;the same to Noah as to me. There&rsquo;s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead somewhere&mdash;to something else than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What&rsquo;s this?&mdash;green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab&rsquo;s head! There&rsquo;s the difference now between man&rsquo;s old age and matter&rsquo;s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that&rsquo;s all.</p></div> </div>
