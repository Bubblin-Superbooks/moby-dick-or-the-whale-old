<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Turn to!&rsquo; roared the Captain.</p><p>&ldquo;Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:&mdash;&lsquo;I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won&rsquo;t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don&rsquo;t do a hand&rsquo;s turn.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&rsquo;ll keep ye there till ye&rsquo;re sick of it. Down ye go.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall we?&rsquo; cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.</p></div> </div>
