<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.</p><p>But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy&mdash;there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale&rsquo;s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the Greenland whale.</p></div> </div>
