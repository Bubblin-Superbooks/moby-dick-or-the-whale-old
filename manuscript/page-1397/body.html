For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it&rsquo;s done, it looks much like Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar.</p><p>There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball.</p></div> </div>
