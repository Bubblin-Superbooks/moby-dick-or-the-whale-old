<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.</p><p>When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even then, in Queequeg&rsquo;s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins&mdash;royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.</p></div> </div>
