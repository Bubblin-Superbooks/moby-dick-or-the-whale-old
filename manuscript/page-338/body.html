<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very dim, very dim,&rdquo; said Elijah. &ldquo;Morning to ye.&rdquo;</p><p>Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and touching my shoulder again, said, &ldquo;See if you can find &lsquo;em now, will ye?</p><p>&ldquo;Find who?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Morning to ye! morning to ye!&rdquo; he rejoined, again moving off. &ldquo;Oh! I was going to warn ye against&mdash;but never mind, never mind&mdash;it&rsquo;s all one, all in the family too;&mdash;sharp frost this morning, ain&rsquo;t it? Good-bye to ye. Shan&rsquo;t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it&rsquo;s before the Grand Jury.&rdquo; And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.</p></div> </div>
