<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.</p><p>&ldquo;Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man&rsquo;s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask&mdash;you know how curious all dreams are&mdash;through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; thinks I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the row? It&rsquo;s not a real leg, only a false leg.&rsquo; And there&rsquo;s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump. That&rsquo;s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.</p></div> </div>
