<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&rsquo;s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.</p><p>Now, this plan of Queequeg&rsquo;s, or rather Yojo&rsquo;s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg&rsquo;s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair.</p></div> </div>
