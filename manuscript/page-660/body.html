<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now, the Captain D&rsquo;Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the honour of being a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.</p><p>In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of honest wonders&mdash;the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier&rsquo;s old chums&mdash;I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be needed.</p></div> </div>
