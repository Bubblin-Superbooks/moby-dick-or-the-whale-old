<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Just as you please; I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it&rsquo;s a plaguy rough board here&rdquo;&mdash;feeling of the knots and notches. &ldquo;But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&rsquo;ve got a carpenter&rsquo;s plane there in the bar&mdash;wait, I say, and I&rsquo;ll make ye snug enough.&rdquo; So saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven&rsquo;s sake to quit&mdash;the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank.</p></div> </div>
