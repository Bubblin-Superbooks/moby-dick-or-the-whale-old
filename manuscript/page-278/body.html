<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&rsquo;s all right enough; thou art shipped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but I should like to see him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what&rsquo;s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&rsquo;t look so. In fact, he ain&rsquo;t sick; but no, he isn&rsquo;t well either. Any how, young man, he won&rsquo;t always see me, so I don&rsquo;t suppose he will thee. He&rsquo;s a queer man, Captain Ahab&mdash;so some think&mdash;but a good one. Oh, thou&rsquo;lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He&rsquo;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn&rsquo;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.</p></div> </div>
