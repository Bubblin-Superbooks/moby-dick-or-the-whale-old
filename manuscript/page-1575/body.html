Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship&rsquo;s company down to doom with him?&mdash;Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant&mdash;put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,&mdash;in there, he&rsquo;s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can&rsquo;t withstand thee, then, old man.</p></div> </div>
