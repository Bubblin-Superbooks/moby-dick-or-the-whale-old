<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou never?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I&rsquo;m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aye, and that&rsquo;s because the lid there&rsquo;s a sounding-board; and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this&mdash;there&rsquo;s naught beneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter. Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate, going in?</p></div> </div>
