<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring, rainbowed jet!&mdash;that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.</p><p>&ldquo;Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
