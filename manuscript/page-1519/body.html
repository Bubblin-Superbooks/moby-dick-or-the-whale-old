For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dying&mdash;the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring&mdash;that strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.</p><p>&ldquo;He turns and turns him to it,&mdash;how slowly, but how steadfastly, his homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!&mdash;Oh that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights. Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets;</p></div> </div>
