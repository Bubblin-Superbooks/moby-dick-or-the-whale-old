<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> They are only five more hands come to help us&mdash;never mind from where&mdash;the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone&mdash;devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that&rsquo;s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that&rsquo;s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men&mdash;all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don&rsquo;t be in a hurry&mdash;don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. Why don&rsquo;t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then:&mdash;softly, softly! That&rsquo;s it&mdash;that&rsquo;s it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.</p></div> </div>
