<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> this savage&rsquo;s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance&mdash;aye, chance, free will, and necessity&mdash;nowise incompatible&mdash;all interweavingly working together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course&mdash;its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.</p><p>Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing.</p></div> </div>
