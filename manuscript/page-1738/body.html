I see thee again.&mdash;Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die&mdash;Down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon.</p></div> </div>
