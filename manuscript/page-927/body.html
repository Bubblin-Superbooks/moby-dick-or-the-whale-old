And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?&rdquo; said Stubb. &ldquo;Where do you expect to go to, cook?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to bed berry soon,&rdquo; he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.</p><p>&ldquo;Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It&rsquo;s an awful question. Now what&rsquo;s your answer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When dis old brack man dies,&rdquo; said the negro slowly, changing his whole air and demeanor, &ldquo;he hisself won&rsquo;t go nowhere; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
