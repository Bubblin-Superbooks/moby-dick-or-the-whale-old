<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;&mdash;but what of that? Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all&mdash;Presbyterians and Pagans alike&mdash;for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.</p><p>Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside. &ldquo;Queequeg,&rdquo; said I softly through the key-hole:&mdash;all silent. &ldquo;I say, Queequeg! why don&rsquo;t you speak? It&rsquo;s I&mdash;Ishmael.&rdquo; But all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed.</p></div> </div>
