At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward&rsquo;s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate&rsquo;s desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one&rsquo;s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity&mdash;Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.</p></div> </div>
