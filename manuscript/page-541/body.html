<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.</p><p>I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where&rsquo;er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.</p><p>Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet&rsquo;s rim, the warm waves blush like wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun&mdash;slow dived from noon&mdash;goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. &lsquo;Tis iron&mdash;that I know&mdash;not gold.</p></div> </div>
