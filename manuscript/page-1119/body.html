<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on, hold on, won&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo; cried Stubb to the body, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
