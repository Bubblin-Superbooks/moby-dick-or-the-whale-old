And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost every dip.</p><p>&ldquo;Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull on! &lsquo;tis the better rest, the shark&rsquo;s jaw than the yielding water.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They will last long enough! pull on!&mdash;But who can tell&rdquo;&mdash;he muttered&mdash;&ldquo;whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab?&mdash;But pull on! Aye, all alive, now&mdash;we near him.</p></div> </div>
