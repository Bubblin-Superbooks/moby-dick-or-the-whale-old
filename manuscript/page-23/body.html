Some say the whale can&rsquo;t open his mouth, but that is a fable.... They frequently climb up the masts to see whether they can see a whale, for the first discoverer has a ducat for his pains.... I was told of a whale taken near Shetland, that had above a barrel of herrings in his belly.... One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over.&rdquo; &mdash;A Voyage to Greenland, A.D. 1671. Harris Coll.</p></div> </div>
