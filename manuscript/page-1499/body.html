<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!&rdquo; deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.</p><p>Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, &ldquo;Good! and now for the seizings.&rdquo;</p><p>At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced half-way along the pole&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
