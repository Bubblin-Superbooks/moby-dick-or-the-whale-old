About this time&mdash;yes, it is his noon nap now&mdash;the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father&rsquo;s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy&rsquo;s face from the window! the boy&rsquo;s hand on the hill!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
