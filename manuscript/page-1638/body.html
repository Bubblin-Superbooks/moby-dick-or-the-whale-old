<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As the unsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months&rsquo; night sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab&rsquo;s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.</p><p>In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab&rsquo;s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old man&rsquo;s despot eye was on them.</p></div> </div>
