<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here&rsquo;s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I&rsquo;ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll&rsquo;s arithmetic, I&rsquo;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&rsquo;s the book. Let&rsquo;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&rsquo;s always among &lsquo;em.</p></div> </div>
