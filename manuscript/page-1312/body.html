<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Had you descended from the Pequod&rsquo;s try-works to the Pequod&rsquo;s forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.</p><p>In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship&rsquo;s black hull still houses an illumination.</p></div> </div>
