Peleg!&rdquo; said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, &ldquo;thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can&rsquo;st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did&rsquo;st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hear him, hear him now,&rdquo; cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,&mdash;&ldquo;hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side;</p></div> </div>
