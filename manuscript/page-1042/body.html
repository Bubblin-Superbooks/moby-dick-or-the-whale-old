If you stand on its summit and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass&mdash;this green, barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the &ldquo;crown,&rdquo; and the Southern fishers the &ldquo;bonnet&rdquo; of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak, with a bird&rsquo;s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term &ldquo;crown&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
