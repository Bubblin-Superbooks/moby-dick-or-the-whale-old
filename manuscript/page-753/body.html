<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each other&rsquo;s cross-bones, the first hail is&mdash;&ldquo;How many skulls?&rdquo;&mdash;the same way that whalers hail&mdash;&ldquo;How many barrels?&rdquo; And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don&rsquo;t like to see overmuch of each other&rsquo;s villanous likenesses.</p></div> </div>
